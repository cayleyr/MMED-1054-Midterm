<h1>Which beverage is really better, coffee or tea?</h1>
<h2>Tea</h2>
<p>Tea is better than coffee because it can taste like so many different things (even coffee if you wanted it to). There are so many different flavours of tea, but you have to be a real coffee conoisseur to even taste the difference in coffee flavours. There is matcha tea, chai tea, green tea, lemon tea, you name it! Coffee can really only blend with flavours like vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, caramel. Tea can blend with all of those PLUS citrus, fruit, and mint!</p>

				<p>Dear Coffee,<br>I love you.<br>Without your morning wakeup, I would be unable to face the world. You are like a coffee compass to me, directing and stabilizing my mood levels to face the chaos of the day.

				<h3>I understand the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGtKGX8B9hU">BAD REPUTATION</a> coffee has gotten.</h3>
				<p>Although there are others who disagree that tea is way better than coffee, coffee truly is a masterpiece to the tastbuds and soul.The acidity that hits you first then, the bitterness and, depending on your drink of choice, the sweetness, sourness, spicy, nutty, earthy taste occupies all your five senses. Uplifting. a word I can get behind to describe the effect coffee has on me. You can ask my parents, who are also coffee lovers.<br>p.s. I add milk and chococlate in mine. I abosolutely cannot handle black coffee, but if you like black coffee, ROCK ON.</p>
