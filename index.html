<h1>Which beverage is really better, coffee or tea?</h1>
<h2>Tea</h2>
<p>Tea is better than coffee because it can taste like so many different things (even coffee if you wanted it to). There are so many different flavours of tea, but you have to be a real coffee conoisseur to even taste the difference in coffee flavours. There is matcha tea, chai tea, green tea, lemon tea, you name it! Coffee can really only blend with flavours like vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, caramel. Tea can blend with all of those PLUS citrus, fruit, and mint!</p>
